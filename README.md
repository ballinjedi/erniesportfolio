Notes:
Javascript file for working button actions and smooth scrolling done in assistance with tutor.

Normalize.css was a file added by recommendation.

Font sources were acquired from google fonts https://fonts.google.com/
Stock images in work section were acquired from https://picsum.photos/

NEED TO FIX:
I opted to have my resume be a part of the nav button rather than have its own section. It broke, so it needs to be fixed. All other sections should work and be clickable.
